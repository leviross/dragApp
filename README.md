# dragApp

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

It is set up with a Sailsjs backend and MongoDB database, but I have to actually continue to develop and save the image drags to the database as a put method. This will allow setup to save on page reload and things like that. 

It was really fun to implement this with a library called ngDraggable, click here for the Github repo:

Please feel free to ask me any questions.
